<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Fourth-year undergraduate student from [School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences](http://sccels.whut.edu.cn), [Wuhan University of Technology](https://www.whut.edu.cn/),mainly engaged in the research of Molecular biology and Synthetic biology.

I will continue my pursuit of a Ph.D. degree at [School of Medicine SongJiang Institute](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sri/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhang](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/sri/kxyj/yjdw1/yjy/z_t.htm) of Zhang Lab, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interest includes cell death and inflammation. Our research group will comprehensively utilize various experimental methods including cell biology, genetics, structural biology, etc., as well as disease mouse models to further investigate the regulatory mechanisms and physiological and pathological functions of RIPK1.

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=zh-CN&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Global+Warming%3A+Temperature+Prediction+Based+on+ARIMA&btnG=) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- In this paper, we describe the global temperature trends in the past century and the global temperature trends in the next century. The findings indicate that global temperatures have demonstrated an upward tendency in the past and in the future. Global warming will further intensify.
